# A Pixel Manipulator for Image Encryption and Decryption

This project is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. The encryption is performed using XOR operations on the RGB values of each pixel, ensuring a simple yet effective encryption mechanism.

## Features
- **Encrypt Images**: Securely encrypt image files using a predefined key.
- **Decrypt Images**: Decrypt previously encrypted images using the same key.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with `Tkinter` for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `Pillow` (for image manipulation)
  - `tkinter` (for GUI)
